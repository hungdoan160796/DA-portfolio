    <h2 id="executive-summary">Executive Summary</h2>

    <p>This report looks into liquor sales over a twelve-month period in 2021, focusing on trends in
      purchasing behavior, product preferences, vendor/store performance, and pricing sensitivity. Key findings
      highlight revenue peaks in March and June, consistent mid-volume purchasing patterns, and strong brand
      concentration within specific price ranges. Behavioral and operational recommendations are provided to optimize
      future marketing, pricing, and stock strategies.</p>

    <p>On a personal note for executives, it's utmost crucial to have data pipelining set up, as a first step to
      marketing and strategies. Suggestions include, but not limited to, setting up customer accounts for coupons. </p>

    <h2 id="deep-dive">Deep-Dive</h2>

    <p>This report presents an analysis of <strong>$428.12M</strong> in liquor sales across twelve months, aiming to
      identify key performance trends, product behaviors, and consumer preferences. The following summarizes the most
      significant findings:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        <p><strong>Sales peaks occurred in March ($36.65M)</strong> and <strong>June ($38.89M)</strong>, correlating
          with increased transaction volume (<strong>260K+ invoices</strong> per month). These peaks reflect heightened
          demand periods rather than isolated high-value purchases.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>On average, customers purchased <strong>11.9 bottles per invoice</strong>, with <strong>54.5%</strong> of
          invoices containing between <strong>9‚Äì10.5 liters</strong> of alcohol. This points to a consistent
          <strong>behavioral saturation threshold</strong>, where most customers appear to stop purchasing based on
          volume rather than price. Recognizing this intuitive decision-making pattern enables tailored strategies such
          as volume-based promotions, ‚Äújust enough‚Äù bundle packs, and product groupings that align with natural consumer
          limits.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>The <strong>top 10 SKUs</strong> includes Tito‚Äôs Handmade Vodka, Captain Morgan, and Fireball Cinnamon. These
          products primarily fall within <strong>750mL‚Äì1.5L bottle sizes</strong> and <strong>packs of 6‚Äì12</strong>,
          reinforcing a preference for mid-volume, value-oriented purchases.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p><strong>Median bottle price was $13.49</strong>, with the vast majority of units sold priced <strong>under
            $50</strong>. Sales volume dropped noticeably above this price point, indicating clear price sensitivity
          even without dynamic pricing data.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p><strong>Top 10 stores</strong> accounted for a dominant portion of total revenue, led by Hy-Vee #3, Central
          City 2, and Costco. Meanwhile, vendors such as <strong>Diageo</strong>, <strong>Sazerac</strong>, and
          <strong>Jim Beam Brands</strong> topped revenue rankings.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Weekday transactions consistently outperformed weekend sales across all stores, suggesting habitual
          purchasing behavior, possibly tied to restocking or pre-weekend planning cycles.</p>
      </li>
    </ul>

    <p>The report concludes with operational recommendations based on observed customer behavior, pricing thresholds,
      and product clustering. Further insight can be obtained by incorporating promotion data, inventory history, and
      customer identifiers in future datasets.</p>

    <h2 id="1-sales-trend-overview">1. Sales Trend Overview</h2>

    <p>Total monthly sales demonstrated a steady upward trend from January to June, peaking in <strong>March
        ($36.65M)</strong> and again in <strong>June ($38.89M)</strong>.</p>

    <p>These surges align with corresponding increases in transaction volume, as evidenced by invoice counts, suggesting
      heightened overall demand rather than changes in spending per transaction.</p>

    <p>From June towards December, a plunge was observed in July considering June was the peak. Figures in sales went
      gradually up towards December, while figures in invoice count experienced a dip in October, rising towards
      December anyways.</p>

        src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ae1bddd6-986c-40df-bfa8-c8ab99b200be" /></p>

    <p>Further analysis of sales distribution by days of the week reveals <strong>stronger performance during
        weekdays</strong> compared to weekends. This consistent pattern throughout the months suggests habitual,
      possibly pre-event or stock-up purchases, rather than spontaneous weekend buying behavior.</p>

    <p><img width="871" height="492" alt="Pasted image 20250807145033"
        src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/3fe6a462-e756-4a69-8b10-5bcdef44ec95" /></p>

    <p>+<strong>Actions to take:</strong> Inventory planning and workforce scheduling should align with weekday demand
      cycles and high-performing months. More specific insight regarding seasons and campaigns from sales required to
      strategically plan discounts during peak seasons/holidays for next year.</p>

    <h2 id="2-product-preference-insights-behavioral-patterns">2. Product Preference Insights &amp; Behavioral Patterns
    </h2>

    <p>The majority of purchases occur within <strong>medium-range product sizes</strong>, specifically bottles between
      <strong>750mL and 1.5L</strong>, sold in <strong>packs of 6‚Äì12</strong>. This indicates a dominant preference for
      convenience-sized units that offer perceived value without excess.
    </p>

    <p>A secondary cluster of high sales volume is observed in <strong>1.75L bottle formats</strong>, with minimal
      activity between <strong>1.25L and 1.5L</strong>. This indicates a <strong>bimodal consumer preference</strong>,
      where buyers either opt for <strong>standard-sized formats</strong> (750‚Äì1000mL) or <strong>bulk-oriented
        purchases</strong> (1.75L). Records of bulk-buyers should be looked into further to gain insight on the behavior
      of this particular group.</p>

    <p><img width="862" height="485" alt="Pasted image 20250807145505"
        src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/11896a17-b67d-4a7e-83ed-8ff68cb5d172" /></p>

    <p><strong>SKU-level analysis</strong> of top-performing products revealed that:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        <p><strong>Tito‚Äôs Handmade Vodka</strong> remained a consistent leader in sales (~28%)</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Products such as <strong>Black Velvet</strong>, <strong>Captain Morgan</strong>, and <strong>Fireball
            Cinnamon</strong> also ranked among the top sellers</p>
      </li>
    </ul>

    <p><img width="871" height="488" alt="Pasted image 20250807152909"
        src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/8fc56524-83ed-4ef0-bcc8-87b15dee3563" /></p>

    <p><strong>Purchasing volumes per invoice</strong> indicate strong clustering:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>54.5% of customers purchased <em>*9‚Äì10.5L *</em></p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>15.27% purchased <strong>4.5L</strong></p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>~30% purchased between <strong>750mL and 1.5L</strong></p>
      </li>
    </ul>

    <p><img width="633" height="478" alt="Pasted image 20250807153803"
        src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1d8c1a89-4628-4623-bdb5-779b67bec144" /></p>

    <p><strong>Interpretation:</strong></p>

    <p>The product analysis reveals a <strong>clear pattern of consumer restraint</strong>, driven not just by price but
      by perceived volume. While customers predominantly purchase <strong>750‚Äì1000mL bottles in packs of 6‚Äì12</strong>,
      invoice-level data shows that <strong>over 54.5%</strong> of transactions total between <strong>9‚Äì10.5L</strong>
      of alcohol. This suggests a <strong>behavioral saturation point</strong> ‚Äî customers appear to stop purchasing
      when they feel they‚Äôve ‚Äúreached enough,‚Äù regardless of additional options or deals available.</p>

    <p>This volume-based heuristic is further supported by the scarcity of purchases beyond 10.5L, despite the
      availability of larger packs or higher volumes. Such behavioral regularity offers a strategic opportunity to
      design promotions, shelf arrangements, and product bundles that align with how customers <strong>intuitively
        measure sufficiency</strong>, rather than relying solely on pricing incentives.</p>

    <h3 id="store-level-performance">üè™ Store-Level Performance</h3>

    <p><img width="875" height="490" alt="Pasted image 20250807160654"
        src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/413aaedb-4f3a-4d45-a622-1358a9c5b9f6" /></p>

    <p>Sales analysis across key store locations indicates that performance is highly concentrated among a few dominant
      outlets:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        <p><strong>Central City 2</strong> led all locations with <strong>$12.10M in sales</strong>, contributing
          <strong>32.18%</strong> of total tracked store revenue
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p><strong>Hy-Vee #3 / Des Moines</strong> followed closely at <strong>$12.26M</strong>, accounting for
          <strong>29.41%</strong>
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p><strong>Costco Wholesale #788 / WDM</strong> contributed <strong>$4.70M</strong> (12.18%)</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Remaining key contributors include:</p>

        <ul>
          <li>
            <p><strong>Hy-Vee Wine and Spirits / Iowa City</strong> ‚Äì $5.45M (15.86%)</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p><strong>Wilkie Liquors</strong> ‚Äì $4.01M (11.15%)</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p><strong>Sam‚Äôs Club 8162 / Cedar Rapids</strong> ‚Äì $3.69M (10.16%)</p>
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>

    <p>Monthly trends show:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        <p><strong>Hy-Vee #3</strong> and <strong>Central City 2</strong> consistently drove monthly performance, with
          <strong>notable surges in March, June, and December</strong>
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p><strong>Costco</strong> and <strong>Sam‚Äôs Club</strong> displayed seasonal variability, with higher
          performance in mid-year months such as <strong>June and July</strong></p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p><strong>Wilkie Liquors</strong> and <strong>Benz Distributing</strong>, while lower in absolute sales,
          maintained steady contributions across all months</p>
      </li>
    </ul>

    <p><strong>Interpretation:</strong> The bulk of revenue is generated by just two locations, which together represent
      <strong>over 60%</strong> of total store-linked sales in the dataset.
    </p>

    <p><strong>Recommendation:</strong></p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>Prioritize <strong>Central City 2</strong> and <strong>Hy-Vee #3</strong> for in-store promotions, new
          product launches, and operational optimization</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Investigate what differentiates these top performers (e.g., customer demographics, layout, stock variety) to
          apply winning practices across other stores</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Leverage <strong>Costco</strong> and <strong>Sam‚Äôs Club</strong> for targeted seasonal campaigns, especially
          in Q2 and Q4 where sales increase</p>

    <p>Analysis of sales by brand reveals that <strong>DIAGEO AMERICAS</strong> dominated with <strong>$84.71M in
        sales</strong>, representing <strong>31.09%</strong> of total revenue. This was followed by:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        <p><strong>SAZERAC COMPANY INC</strong> ‚Äì $52.33M (19.21%)</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p><strong>Jim Beam Brands</strong> ‚Äì $32.05M (11.76%)</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p><strong>Heaven Hill Brands</strong> ‚Äì $27.02M (9.92%)</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p><strong>PERNOD RICARD USA</strong> ‚Äì $26.43M (9.70%)</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p><strong>FIFTH GENERATION INC</strong> ‚Äì $25.98M (9.54%)</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p><strong>BACARDI USA INC</strong> ‚Äì $23.90M (8.77%)</p>
      </li>
    </ul>

    <p>Monthly breakdowns show that:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        <p><strong>SAZERAC</strong> maintained steady performance across the year, often leading month-to-month</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p><strong>DIAGEO</strong> surged strongly in the second half of the year</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Other vendors (e.g., <strong>FIFTH GENERATION INC</strong>) showed intermittent spikes, contributing to
          monthly peaks</p>
      </li>
    </ul>

    <p>This distribution reflects both consistent vendor loyalty and brand-driven purchasing behavior.</p>

    <p><strong>Recommendation:</strong> Strengthen partnerships with top 3 vendors (DIAGEO, SAZERAC, Jim Beam), who
      together account for over <strong>60% of annual sales</strong>. Vendors showing seasonal surges may be candidates
      for <strong>targeted promotions or product launches</strong> during key months.</p>

    <h2 id="4-pricing-behavior">4. Pricing Behavior</h2>

    <p>Sales distribution across price ranges illustrates a clear concentration below the <strong>$50</strong>
      threshold, with the <strong>$10‚Äì$30</strong> band accounting for the majority of units sold. The <strong>median
        bottle price</strong> was <strong>$13.49</strong>, reinforcing the value-driven nature of purchasing behavior.
    </p>

    <p><img width="212" height="106" alt="Pasted image 20250807145850"
        src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/20c20f6f-d3fa-49f8-ab69-f7edd56d1b2a" /></p>

    <p><img width="873" height="496" alt="Pasted image 20250807145917"
        src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0d7799f1-9cff-4441-8b93-a86b6ae86bb3" /></p>

    <p>While direct analysis of price elasticity was not feasible due to static pricing, customer sensitivity to price
      ceilings is evident. Sales volume drops significantly past the $50 mark.</p>

    <p><strong>Recommendation:</strong> Optimize pricing strategies by positioning products at psychologically appealing
      thresholds (e.g., $39.99, $49.99), and consider volume-based pricing bundles that remain under $100.</p>
